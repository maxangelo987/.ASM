A86 and D86 do not create any Windows registry entries, and they do
not place any files in any system directories.

If you wish to delete A86 and D86 from your system, simply delete
all the files in the A86 directory, and then remove the directory.
In DOS, this would be done via a sequence of commands such as:

   C:
   CD \A86
   DEL *.*
   CD \
   RD A86

If you are running Windows 95 or later, you can do this by going via
My Computer to the drive containing the A86 folder, and then dragging
the A86 folder to the Recycle Bin.
